Introduction
============



This product contains content types for bda.plone.shop.
It will also install bda.plone.shopviews that contains demo view templates.
There is 3 content types.

1) Product which contains two images and two rich text fields.
   The rich text fields will have their own tabs at the bottom
2) Productgroup
3) Variations that can be added inside a Productgroup folder.
   You should set the view of Productgroup to one of the Variation


Currently, the cart is only working with UIDs that are present when the javascript is loading. Therefor, all the Variations is loaded, which might be a bit slot.
Suggestions on how to overcome this problem is welcome.
